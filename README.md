# Business Landing Page

My first landing page project using HTML and CSS! 

## What I Built

A simple business landing page with:
- Navigation menu at the top
- Hero section with gradient background
- Services section with cards
- About section with some stats
- Client testimonials
- Contact form
- Footer with social links

## What I Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Font Awesome icons

## Files

- `index.html` - the main page
- `style.css` - all the styling
- `README.md` - this file

## How to View

Just open `index.html` in your browser and that's it!

## What I Learned

- How to use CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Making responsive designs
- Adding hover effects
- Using gradients and animations
- Working with Font Awesome icons
- Creating forms

## Things I Want to Add Later

- Make the form actually work
- Add more animations
- Maybe add some JavaScript
- Make it even more responsive

## Notes

This is my learning project. I tried to make it look professional but I'm still learning!

Feel free to use this code if you want to learn too.
